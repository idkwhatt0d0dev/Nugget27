# nugget27
Unlock your device's full potential, with iOS 27 support!

Customize your device with animated wallpapers, disable pesky daemons, and more!

Make sure you have installed the [requirements](#requirements) if you are on Windows or Linux.

> [!WARNING]
> You will need to re-login in your apple ID if using on IOS 27

> [!WARNING]
> This fork implements a three-phase backup→tweak→restore workflow to prevent data loss on iOS 27. Apple has patched the partial restore method that Nugget uses, so applying tweaks directly now triggers a security response that wipes AppleID, Keychain, Photos and settings. This fork preserves your data by backing it up first, then restoring it after the tweak is applied. **THIS WORKAROUND IS UNSTABLE NOW, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DATA LOSS/BOOTLOOP CAUSED BY GOLDENNUGGET.**

> [!NOTE]
> Please back up your data before using this Project! GoldenNugget may cause unforeseen problems, so it is better to be safe than sorry. We are not responsible for any damage done to your device.

## Running the Python Program
> [!NOTE]
> It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment:
> ```py
> python3 -m venv .env # only needed once
> ```
macOS/Linux:
```py
source .env/bin/activate
```
Windows:
```py
.env/Scripts/activate.bat
```
Install Packages:
```py
pip3 install -r requirements.txt # only needed once
python3 main_app.py
```
> [!NOTE]
> Depending on your system configuration, use either `python/pip` or `python3/pip3`.

## Building
To compile `mainwindow.ui` for Python, run the following command:
```py
pyside6-uic --from-imports src/qt/mainwindow.ui -o src/qt/mainwindow_ui.py
```

To compile the resources file for Python, run the following command:
```py
pyside6-rcc src/qt/resources.qrc -o src/qt/resources_rc.py
```

To create and compile languages, you can use the following commands:
```py
pyside6-lupdate src/gui/main_window.py src/gui/pages/page.py src/gui/pages/reset_dialog.py src/gui/pages/main/*.py src/gui/pages/tools/*.py src/gui/dialogs.py src/qt/mainwindow.ui src/devicemanagement/device_manager.py src/exceptions/*.py src/tweaks/*.py src/tweaks/posterboard/*.py src/tweaks/posterboard/template_options/*.py src/controllers/*.py -ts src/qt/translations/Nugget_{language code}.ts # generate/update the language file
pyside6-lrelease src/qt/translations/Nugget_{language code}.ts -qm src/qt/translations/Nugget_{language code}.qm # compile to binary
```

The application itself can be compiled by running `compile.py`.
